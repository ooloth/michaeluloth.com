{"id":"META-val","title":"Add automated metadata validation/testing","description":"Create automated validation for social sharing metadata to replace manual checking via metatags.io, Twitter card validator, etc.\n\n**IMPORTANT: This should NOT be vitest-based tests. Use browser automation (Playwright) to validate what users will actually see when sharing links on Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.**\n\nOptions to explore:\n1. Playwright tests that render pages in actual browser and validate metadata tags in the rendered DOM\n2. Playwright tests that capture screenshots of social preview cards\n3. Integration with Open Graph debugger APIs if available\n4. Schema validation for JSON-LD structured data in rendered pages\n\nRequirements:\n- Validate all pages have required OG tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url) in rendered HTML\n- Validate Twitter card tags (twitter:card, twitter:title, twitter:description, twitter:image) in rendered HTML\n- Validate image URLs are accessible and have correct dimensions (1200x630 for OG images)\n- Validate JSON-LD schema correctness in rendered pages\n- Fail build on missing/invalid metadata\n\nGoal: Catch metadata issues at build time by validating the actual rendered output, not just the Next.js metadata API output.","status":"closed","priority":4,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:21:09.650384-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T23:25:48.648652-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T23:25:48.648652-05:00","close_reason":"Validation complete: Implemented automated HTML parsing with Cheerio to validate all OG tags (including og:site_name, og:locale) and Twitter Card tags (including twitter:creator) in rendered build output.
